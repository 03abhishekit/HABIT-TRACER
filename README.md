 <h3>Backend</h3>
 
  <p>The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, and it uses MongoDB for data storage.</p> 
  
  <h3>Frontend</h3> 
  
  <p>The frontend is built with React and TypeScript.</p> 
  
  <p>The client side uses Cypress for End-to-End (E2E) tests. To run these tests, start the backend development server in test mode with the following command:
  
   <br /> `npm run start:test`<br /> 
   
   <br /> Then, start the frontend with `npm start`<br />
   
 and open Cypress in the /frontend folder using 
 
 `npm run cypress:open`<br /></p> <p>The server side uses Jest and Supertest for integration tests. To run these tests, use the command <br /> 
 
 `npm test`<br /> in the backend root folder.</p>
